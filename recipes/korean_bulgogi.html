    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>

        <li>5 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 inch piece ginger, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup cooked brown rice, or more to taste</li>

    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Mix in sesame oil.</li>
        <li>Combine brown sugar, soy sauce, water, Asian pear, garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes, and black pepper in a food processor. Blend until combined but still slightly chunky.

        <li>Place 1/4 the cooked brown rice in the bottom of an individual serving bowl. Top with a portion of beef mixture, lettuce, cucumber, red bell pepper, and sesame seeds. Repeat with remaining rice, beef, and toppings.</li>
